            Founded in 2014, STEM Gharbiya is a public boarding high school created as part of Egypt's national
            STEM education initiative under the Ministry of Education to support outstanding students. The school
            serves more than 300 students and accepts over 100 new students each year. As a full residential
            campus, it provides dormitory accommodation, daily meals, structured study halls, and student support
            services that enable learners to focus on academic and personal growth.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-sm leading-7 text-muted-foreground md:text-base">
            Across academics, faculty mentorship, admission pathways, and extracurricular programs, students study
            through an integrated project-based model that connects mathematics, science, technology, and engineering
            to real-world challenges. This educational approach strengthens research skills, critical thinking,
            teamwork, and leadership, preparing graduates for university-level study and long-term contribution to
            science, innovation, and national development.
