            Yes! During the application, you rank all 21 STEM schools in Egypt by your preference. 
            If you're accepted, you're assigned to one school based on your ranking and test score. 
            You can't choose your school—placement is based on your ranking and overall competition.

            Your final ranking is based solely on your <strong>entrance exam score</strong> (not your Grade 9 grades). 
            The exam has 4 sections: Maths, English, Science, and IQ—each with equal weight. 
            Students are ranked nationally by total score.

            STEM schools no longer maintain waitlists. Acceptance decisions are final—there are no appeals or 
            waitlist positions. We encourage students to reach out to the school counselor for feedback and guidance 
            on alternative pathways.
