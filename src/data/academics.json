  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What makes STEM Gharbiya academics different?",
      "answer": "Our curriculum centers on student-driven learning with hands-on research, collaborative projects, and real-world problem-solving. We combine rigorous academics with mentorship and innovation labs to develop researchers and leaders, not just test-takers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are courses honors or AP?",
      "answer": "Most STEM-core courses are taught at the honors level. We focus on deep conceptual understanding and research skills rather than AP test preparation. Honors courses are more rigorous and project-intensive than regular courses."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are capstone projects graded?",
      "answer": "Capstone projects count toward 40% of final grades in STEM core courses. Grading is based on research quality, innovation, collaboration, presentation, and real-world impact. Projects are evaluated by faculty mentors and sometimes external experts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the student-teacher ratio for lab courses?",
      "answer": "Our science and engineering labs maintain a 1:15 ratio to ensure hands-on support. Each student works directly with faculty and lab technicians on experiments and builds."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the grading system work?",
      "answer": "We use a letter grading system from A+ to F. Grades reflect mastery of content, research contribution, and presentation skills. Mid-term and final projects are weighted more heavily than traditional exams."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I choose between math and science tracks?",
      "answer": "Yes. All students take a core set of subjects, but you can choose either a Mathematics-focused or Sciences-focused track starting in 11th grade. Both tracks include engineering and innovation modules."
    },
    {
      "question": "What support is available for struggling students?",
      "answer": "We offer peer tutoring, faculty office hours, study groups, and academic counseling. Students who fall behind in STEM courses receive additional mentoring and can access recorded lectures and resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do universities view our academics?",
      "answer": "Top universities recognize our rigorous curriculum and research outcomes. Our graduates have earned scholarships and admissions to leading STEM programs globally. Our capstone projects and research experience give students a significant advantage."
